# Changelog

## 1.2.0
- Prevent hotkey activation in QuickLoot menu.
- Fix mod not recognizing equipped shields during hotkey creation.
- Stop hotkeys from tracking tempering suffixes of items with custom names. Prior to this change, if you named a weapon "Awesome Weapon" and then upgraded it, its name might become "Awesome Weapon (Fine)", and a hotkey with this weapon will not recognize "Awesome Weapon" at any other upgrade level.

## 1.1.0
- Hotkeys now pick the most upgraded version of whatever is in your inventory (assuming custom gear name and enchantment already match). Your gear no longer needs to be at the exact same upgrade level as when you hotkeyed it.

## 1.0.0
- Supported game versions: 1.5.97, 1.6.640, 1.6.1130
